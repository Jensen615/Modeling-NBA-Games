# Modeling-NBA-Games
NBA Basketball is arguably the most exciting sport in the world. With quite an abundance of actively invested NBA fans—producing data-driven models and simulations of live games would prove to be very beneficial. We gather play-by-play data from the 2018-2019 NBA season to not only develop shooting patterns and playing trends for all 30 teams but to also analyze the inter-arrival times of shots taken and made in a game. We use the results from this data to understand team preferences for shooting two- and three-pointers and finally, model each NBA game as a bivariate Hawkes process. A Hawkes process is a self–exciting model in which the occurrence of an event increases the probability of another event occurring. Ultimately, this model supposes that past events can temporarily raise the probability of future events. Bivariate Hawkes processes—a variation of Hawkes process—is relevant for the NBA because when one team scores in basketball, the other team obtains the ball and it increases the likelihood that the other team scores during the next possession. Thus, the back and forth dynamic of a basketball match lends itself naturally to bivariate Hawkes models.
